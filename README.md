# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms on Classification problems

This paper seeks to extend upon previous studieson supervised machine learning algorithms, withan emphasis on solving classifcation problems. Work was done utilizing several supervised learning methods, including: decision trees, randomforests, bagging classifer, and SVM. Such methods were tried on several datasets that ranged in their features, targets, and sizes. The metrics were how well the algorithms performed in terms ofclassifcation accuracy. Results showed some similarity with previous studies, with some variationin the ranking of how well each algorithm did. Some points for future research would be to look into larger datasets consisting of more features as well as a more diverse spread of points.
