# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms on Classification problems

This paper seeks to extend upon previous studies on supervised machine learning algorithms, withan emphasis on solving classifcation problems. Work was done utilizing several supervised learning methods, including: decision trees, randomforests, bagging classifer, and SVM. Such methods were tried on several datasets that ranged in their features, targets, and sizes. The metrics were how well the algorithms performed in terms ofclassifcation accuracy. Results showed some similarity with previous studies, with some variationin the ranking of how well each algorithm did. Some points for future research would be to look into larger datasets consisting of more features as well as a more diverse spread of points.

This project involved the usage of Python and several libraries (NumPy, pandas, SciPy); implementation of supervised machine learning algorithms and techniques; properly reported project write-up with correct notation.

The report is uploaded as part of the GitHub repository (along with the individual codes for each dataset).
